# Voice-Guided Scene Understanding Assistant

## Description:
This application assists visually impaired users by describing their surroundings through voice. The user can use simple voice commands such as “What’s around me?” or “Describe this scene.” The app captures an image or video using the device camera, processes it with a vision-language model, and provides a spoken description of what’s detected — people, objects, actions, and scene context.

It aims to create independence by enabling users to understand their environment hands-free, powered by AI-driven image captioning and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies.
